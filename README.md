# Spixi
Spixi is a multiplatform, decentralized and privacy-oriented chat application that brings together users from different platforms. Because Spixi operates on top of Ixian S2 and DLT networks, it includes a set of distinctive features:

* Decentralized architecture ensures practically no downtime. Backend is based on the Ixian DLT and Ixian S2 streaming network to provide ultimate decentralization and security.
* Cryptographically secure (dual end-to-end encryption), which means that only the intended recipient can read messages.
* Multi-platform (PC, iOS, Android, others)
* Ixian DLT integration, which enables cryptocurrency wallet features right in the IM client.
* Messages are not stored in any one country or central location. There is no legal or corporate entity that possesses all of the messages, so no entity can meaningfully demand or obtain decryption keys.


## Development branches

There are two main development branches:
* **master**: This branch is used to build the binaries for the latest stable release of Spixi. It should change slowly and be quite well-tested. This is also the default branch for anyone who wishes to build their Ixian software from source.
* **development**: This is the main development branch. The branch might not always be kept bug-free, if an extensive new feature is being worked on. If you are simply looking to build a current binary yourself, please use one of the release tags which will be associated with the master branch.

## Documentation

You can find documentation on how to build, APIs and other documents on [Ixian Documentation Pages](https://docs.ixian.io).
